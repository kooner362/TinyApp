# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
TinyApp will allow you to shorten all URLs and reuse them to redirect to the full URL which it refers to.  TinyApp also keeps
track of the number of visits to each shortened link and unique visits to the shortened link.
